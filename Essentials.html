            <h1>Essentials to build a website</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="blog-body">
            <p>In this fast-paced world, it is important to have a solid social network and exposure to get
                the organizational or business value to the targeted customers and one of the very few ways
                available for this task to be accomplished is through a well versed and developed website
                with a clean and compatible design. So whenever someone decides to enter the world of
                creating a new website for their budding or well-established business they should consider a
                few key points to catch the eye of the visitor who might be a potential customer. These
                points include:
            </p>
            <p>
                Requirement analysis:
                The first step always begins with questions. One needs to follow the 5W process to get to
                the proper gateway for the successful first step. These 5 Wâ€™s are What Why When Where Who.
                What- What is our final goal. What is the final image of our website?
                Why- Why the website needed to be developed.
                When- When the data traffic should be monitored.
                Where- Which domain we are entering and where we are going to publish this.
                Who- Who makes up the major part of our customer base. Whom we are targeting to convert them
                into a potential customer.
            <p>
                Plan and budget :
                Once we have the basic questions answered, all we have to do is make a plan of action. How
                things should be achieved. Have blueprints and flow charts of the business website handy.
                The budget should also be decided to base on the investment we have and the requirement we
                have.
            </p>
            <p>
                Compatible technology:
                The next major thing that should be taken care of would be the selection of compatible
                technology. We have a plethora of options when the topic of technology is considered.
                Technologies like HTML, PHP, BOOTSTRAP were widely in use in the current scenario. A proper
                database setup should be established to have background data storage foe maintaining the
                client data efficiently. Options like SQL, Oracle, MongoDB, etc are available in the market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please find one good web developer to take care of necessary jargon and to help to select
                the appropriate tools and designs according to requirements and necessities to develop a
                well established and sophisticated website.
